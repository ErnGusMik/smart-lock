# Smart door lock
I'm creating a smart door lock using Hack Club's Bin. It's going to use a keypad for authorization and an LED light 'strip' to show the status. From the other side, the lock will open using a button and an RGB light to show the status. The lock will be a servo motor.

### Todo later (notes to self)
* Once keypad is pressed, wait
